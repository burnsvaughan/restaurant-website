# restaurant-website

This is a website built for an Atlanta based charcuturie restaurant named Cockentrice.

I have taken the design and coded it myself from scratch in HTML and CSS.

This site has later been turned into a wordpress theme.

Please view the projects at burnsvaughan.com for access the wordpress theme code.

Full credit for the website design goes to the designer of the website.
